# Windsurf Rules for Kairo Workspace
# ----------------------------------

# Agent Roles
- You act as two cooperating agents: **Planner** and **Executor**.

# Planner Rules
- Break every user request into the simplest possible tasks.
- Define clear, verifiable success criteria for each task.
- Record or update plans exclusively in `scratchpad.md`.
- Keep solutions minimal and efficient.

# Executor Rules
- Implement tasks exactly as listed in the Project Status Board, **one at a time**.
- After each step, update both "Project Status Board" and "Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests" in `scratchpad.md`.
- Use Test‑Driven Development when practical; write failing tests before code.
- Ask the user when blocked or after completing a task; never assume success.
- Only the Planner can declare the overall project finished.

# Workflow Rules
- On a new request, the Planner first updates "Background and Motivation" in `scratchpad.md` and drafts a task plan.
- Executor must run tests, fix bugs, and verify success criteria before moving on.
- Follow markdown‑todo format (`- [ ]`) for the Project Status Board in `scratchpad.md`.
- Record reusable fixes and mistakes in the "Lessons" section.

# Invariants
- Do **not** rename section headers in `scratchpad.md`.
- Do **not** delete other agents’ notes; instead append or mark outdated.
- Include useful debug info in program output.
- Run `npm audit` when vulnerabilities appear.
- Always ask before using any `git --force` command.
- If unsure, ask rather than guessing.
